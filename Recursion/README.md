# RECURSION
Below are my notes for recursion. 

### Problem
Given N, count all ‘a’ and ‘b’ that satisfy the condition a^3 + b^3 = N. [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-pairs-a-b-whose-sum-of-cubes-is-n-a3-b3-n/)

### Approach
Approach would be to traverse through number from 0 to n/2 ,as we have to find pair so n/2 now subtract n - b^3 to find a^3 and increase count++ the loop will run till n > b^3

### Solution

[Firstly, try yourself](https://github.com/utsav-verma/DSA/blob/main/Recursion/find_pair.java)
